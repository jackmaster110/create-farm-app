# Create Farm App

#### Arguments: ####

"--no-git" | "-ng": Doesn't init a git repo at the project root

"--no-install" | "-i": Doesn't auto install dependencies for the backend

"--yes" | "-y": Makes a project with all the default values

The project uses my create-react-app template, but you can always delete the frontend if you hate my choices. If you're planning to deploy your app, I recommend starting without a git repo and making the backend and frontend submodules. It just has felt easier in my experience, but you can do it however you want.
